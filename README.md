# "Scribbleio bot"
Program that automatically recreates given image in scribble.io game.

It may not work correctly due to difference in scribble.io painting tools positions on different screens. `coordinates.py` is to help finding correct coordinates values.
The program is quite provisional and could be improved by me in the future.

Look at `examples` directory to see example results.
